    longDescription: >
      Manage delivery of goods in presence.  This application was created to
      manage a valid list of users for  the delivery of an asset, such as sim
      cards or a 4g routers.  This application can therefore manage a stock of
      uniquely  identifiable products and at the same time serve for the
      delivery  of anonymous goods, such as glasses of water or food  (goods
      without any identificative value).

      Principali caratteristiche:

      - Delivery operations are organized through the definition of Campaigns,
      in a specific time interval;

      - Each campaign involves the activation of Delivery Points, whit users
      with privileges to manage the flow, called operators;

      - Each campaign can eventually show an Agreement, the user is required to
      accept when collecting the goods, before the delivery can be intended as
      succesfully concluded;

      - A stock of available products is defined for each delivery point, each
      of which may or may not be identified by a code. Glass of water could not
      have a identification code, SIM card should instead.
